# Djobeet

Django version of Symfony Jobeet tutorial.

Jobeet is a great tutorial on how to build a fully functional job board site. It was written by the Symfony team for Symfony 1.x version and I want to adapt it for Django ecosystem.

In the following weeks I will begin to post the parts of making the Djobeet site using Django 2.2, so it will help beginners to learn and understand how the framework works.
I will try to follow the original Jobeet tutorial, but I will also make some changes to include new or similar technologies and to reflect my personal developing style.

Please be free to make any observations and improvements you consider important by commenting on the posts that will follow.
